The files in this directory will be generated automatically on systems
supporting the autobuild process. You should therefore not edit any of
them. If you need to alter code in any of these files you should
instead edit the corresponding file that generates it.

If you have trouble building any of these files you may copy the file
causing problems from this directory to its intended location.
